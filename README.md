# sandpiles-cpp

I've been toying around with Abelian sandpiles for about a year now. 

Im still not satisfied with the speed, so I keep making versions and testing them.

Someday I intend to document my results. 

Dynamically resizing the array to allow it to expand, keeping a 10-pixel border around the sandpile.
